## Hexo-Blog (leever.cn)

### About this Repository
Originally used for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/karped1ems/).  
Since switching to a personal server, GitHub [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions/) are no longer used for updates.  
However, the Vercel deployment is still available — you can visit it [here](https://hexo-blog-karped1ems.vercel.app/).

### About Open Source
Currently, only the generated pages and assets of my blog are public. The source code itself remains private, as it contains unpublished (pre-encrypted) articles.  

If you’d like to build a similar site:  
- Use the [Butterfly theme](https://butterfly.js.org/) (make sure to use the latest version, as my blog is maintained against it).  
- Check out [Akilarの糖果屋](https://akilar.top/) for tutorials on theme customization.  

If you need help, feel free to open an Issue in this repository.
